<section>
<h2>Understanding Engineered Hardwood</h2>
<p>
Engineered hardwood consists of multiple layers of wood, with a real hardwood veneer on top. 
It is more stable than solid hardwood in areas with humidity changes and can often be installed over concrete or radiant heating.

and explore their complete flooring solutions in St. Louis, MO.
</p>

<h2>Understanding Solid Hardwood</h2>
<p>
Solid hardwood is made from a single piece of wood, offering timeless beauty and durability. 
It can be sanded and refinished multiple times, making it perfect for long-term use. 
However, it is more sensitive to moisture and temperature changes, so proper installation by professionals is crucial.
</p>

<h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
<p>
Engineered hardwood is usually slightly less expensive than solid hardwood, but pricing depends on wood species, plank thickness, and finish. 
Installation cost varies based on room size and preparation work. 
For detailed estimates and expert guidance, you can request a consultation through their 
<a href="https://abelnfloorsystemsltd.com/contact-us/">Contact Page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Benefits of Choosing the Right Hardwood</h2>
<p>
Both options increase property value, improve indoor air quality, and add elegance to your home. 
Engineered hardwood offers flexibility in installation, while solid hardwood offers unmatched longevity.
